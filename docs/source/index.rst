Welcome to Gazu's documentation!
================================

Gazu is a Python client for the Kitsu API. It allows fetching easily
your CG production data. More than giving access to data, it allows
performing operations on it like marking a task as started or setting a
thumbnail on a shot. 

*NB: It requires an up and running instance of the Kitsu API to run properly.*

Who is it for?
==============

The audience for this Python client is Technical Artists, Technical Directors
and Software Engineers from CG studios. With Gazu they can augment their tools
with the CG production data. 

Use cases
=========

Here is a non exhaustive list of use cases that allows Gazu:

* Make sure that every artist workstations are on the same page when dealing
  with the file system.
* Build a todo list for artists of the project.
* Get working file paths and output file paths for a given task.
* Get next available working revision for a given task.
* Manage automatic validation changes.

Sources
=======

The source is available on Github_.
